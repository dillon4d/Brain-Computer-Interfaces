# Assignment 3
## Assigned: Monday, 01 March 2021
## Due: Sunday, 14 March 2021 @ 11:59 PM PST

This assignment will go through using CSP to train a 2-class LDA classifier on motor imagery competition data. You will need
to do some programming for this assignment, but it should be well within the scope of your abilities. We have switched back
to using Google Docs as the reference page for the assignment as Live Script felt like it was more of a hastle to use and
did not promote thoughtful completion of the assignment. 
<br><br>
Please note that you will need to download approximately 1.2 GB worth of data for this assignment. If you are running low
on disk space, your performance will not be particularly hindered if the files are downloaded to a removable media. All of the
files are read at the start of the assignment and there are no other read/write operations.
<br><br>
You will be uploading 'A3.m' as your submission to Gradescope. Every question will be answered within A3.m. Please do not modify
the variables which contain answers such as Q1_ANS, Q2_ANS, etc. Make sure your code executes and runs to completion before
submitting your final script to Gradescope.
